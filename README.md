🚀 Project Overview
This project covers:

Data Modeling: Designing a star/snowflake schema for the warehouse.
ETL Process: Extract, Transform, Load scripts to populate the warehouse.
Analytical Queries: Complex queries for reporting and insights.
📊 Features
✅ Star schema or snowflake schema design
✅ Fact and dimension tables
✅ ETL implementation using SQL scripts
✅ Analytical queries for common business questions

🔧 Technologies Used
SQL Server (or MySQL / PostgreSQL, update accordingly)
SQL scripts for ETL and analytics
📈 How to Use
Clone the repository: Load the schema and data: Run the scripts in sql/schema.sql to create tables. Run the scripts in sql/etl.sql to load data into the tables. Run analytical queries: Use the queries in sql/queries.sql or the files in reports/ to generate reports.

📂 Data Sources The data used in this project consists of sample datasets that simulate a sales database. It includes data about: Customers Products Sales Transactions Time (Date) Dimension These data files are included in the data/ directory and are loaded into the data warehouse using ETL scripts.
